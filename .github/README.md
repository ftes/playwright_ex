# Dependency updates

Install the [Renovate GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/renovate) for
`ftes/playwright_ex` to activate `renovate.json`. Renovate discovers Mix and npm
projects, GitHub Actions, and all Elixir, Erlang and Node pins in `.tool-versions`.
It also updates pnpm wherever configured, grouping its package-manager pin with
the toolchain updates.

Update PRs are scheduled for Monday 00:00–06:59 Europe/Berlin, with a two-day
minimum release age where timestamps are available (three days for npm via the
best-practices preset). Patch, minor and major
updates are eligible; automerge is disabled. GitHub Actions retain full commit
SHA pins with version comments. CI reads `.tool-versions` directly.

Elixir retains its OTP build suffix. An Erlang major upgrade may require choosing
a compatible Elixir build before the PR passes CI. Minimum Node engine constraints
remain a manual compatibility decision.

Use the Renovate Dependency Dashboard issue or the
[Mend portal](https://developer.mend.io/github/ftes/playwright_ex) to inspect
updates and job logs. Keep GitHub's Dependabot security alerts enabled separately;
Renovate replaces Dependabot's version-update configuration.

Renovate extends `config:best-practices`, including action/container digest pins,
development-dependency pins and weekly lockfile maintenance. Mix overrides the
preset's development-dependency pinning with `widen`: weekly maintenance lets Mix
resolve the newest allowed versions in `mix.lock`, while out-of-range releases
produce PRs widening `mix.exs` constraints without dropping existing support.
These compatibility changes require review; automerge remains disabled.
Two-part `~> 0.x` constraints use equivalent explicit ranges such as
`>= 0.3.0 and < 1.0.0` to avoid Renovate incorrectly treating later `0.x` releases
as out of range. Three-part constraints such as `~> 0.3.0` retain their syntax.
Other dependency ranges retain `replace`, except where the preset pins
development dependencies.

Renovate generates Mix lockfiles with OTP 29 and Elixir 1.20.4, configured via
`constraints`. Its Mix worker otherwise defaults to OTP 26, which cannot run
Elixir 1.20. These worker constraints do not restrict proposed toolchain updates;
review them when adopting a newer Elixir/OTP release line.
