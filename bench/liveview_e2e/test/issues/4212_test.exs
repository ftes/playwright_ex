  # stream_insert(..., at: idx) used to call insertBefore() inside
  # maybeReOrderStream, which detaches and re-attaches the moved DOM node and
  # fires extra disconnectedCallback / connectedCallback cycles on custom
  # elements. The fix routes the reorder through the atomic moveBefore() API
  # when the runtime supports it. We assert that connectedMoveCallback fires
  # (direct evidence that moveBefore was used) and that no spurious
  # disconnect happened on the just-inserted element.
