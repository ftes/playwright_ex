    # This reproduces an issue where a locked element itself was skipped (data-phx-skip).
    # We have a hook on the skip element, which sends an event to a child LiveView.
    # Because the child LiveView is deliberately slow to process that event, the lock
    # stays active for a while. During that time, the child also sends an update to
    # the parent, which bumps a counter both outside and inside the locked panel.
    # The important regression assertion is that the child label remains "child 0"
    # while #locked-panel is still locked:
    # the "child 1" patch must be written to the private locked clone and only become
    # visible after the lock is acked.
